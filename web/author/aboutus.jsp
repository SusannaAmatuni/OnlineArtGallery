 This web site developed, designed, and hosted by Susanna Amatuni.<br>
 What is the purpose of this web site if it doesn’t let you to enter credit<br>
 card number and make the owner of the site incredibly rich? The answer is simple.<br>
 She doesn't want to sell her paintings.<br><br> 
 Susanna Amatuni despite being an accomplished  artist is also a very serious Web Component Developer<br>
 Her philosophy is never give up and try get on your feet even if you were thrown down.<br>
 She was out of computer job field for some period of time, because she was busy raising kids.<br> 
 When the time came that she was able to join the computer job workforce she discovered that the <br>
 time is not good, it is really hard to find a job. But she is not the type of person that<br>
 will be afraid of challenges. Susanna Amatuni has Master’s degree in computer science,<br>
 but she didn’t stop there. She studied on her own and passed successfully two challenging tests<br>
     and became Sun Certified Java Programmer and Oracle Certified Web Component Developer.<br><br>
     
 After these tests when she was trying to apply for a job the first question that the employers ask her<br>
     was does she have an working experience?
<p>
This web site is one of her resent work experiences; this is her work from the beginning to the end.
This is a very unique web site, because it’s back end, front end and even “filling” created
by one person.<p>
    I hope you would be interested in my work and will contact me.
